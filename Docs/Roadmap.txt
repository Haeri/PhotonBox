RENDERING
- Instanced rendering
- Deferred decals
- Switch to GTAO
- TAA
- Draw handles
- GBuffer packing
- Dynamic Shadow bounding update

GENERAL
- Zlib binary file compression
- Switch image format to compressed ddt
- Resource manager
	- Protected constructors for managed resources
	- Load next before unload to pass already loaded resources
- Frustum culling
- Recursive lightmap generation with light conservation
- Uniform buffer
- Precompile shader
- Run Filewatcher parallel in an interval
- GL-State system: define all needed properties befre draw call. System compares 
	what state is to what it should be and only changes properties that are needed.
- SIMD math
- License - MIT?
- Wrap everything in PhotonBox namespace
- Abstraction layer over OpenGL
- Precompiled header
- Switch to dll
- User Premake or CMake
- Decouple asset conversion into its own Project (AssetCompiler)
- Create Shader as JSON resource -> Eliminate Shader classes
- (Move Scene classes to JSON resources)
- General configurator for static defines (Depth prepass, Resource path)
- Update dependencies

RESOURCES
- Textures	-> .DDT
- Mesh		-> .Mesh
- Shader	-> .JSON

BUGS
- Eye-adaptation freaking out with high framerate
- SSReflection overflowing colors when too bright
