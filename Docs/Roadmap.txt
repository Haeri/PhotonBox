RENDERING
- Instanced rendering
- Deferred decals
- Switch to GTAO
- Draw handles
- GBuffer packing
- Dynamic Shadow bounding update
- Anisotropic filtering

GENERAL
- Resource manager
	- Protected constructors for managed resources
	- Load next before unload to pass already loaded resources
- Recursive light map generation with light conservation
- Precompile shader
- GL-State system: define all needed properties before draw call. System compares 
	what state is to what it should be and only changes properties that are needed.
- Wrap everything in PhotonBox name space
- Abstraction layer over OpenGL
- Precompiled headers
- Switch to dll
- Decouple asset conversion into its own Project (AssetCompiler)
- Create Shader as JSON resource -> Eliminate Shader classes
- (Move Scene classes to JSON resources)
- General configuration for static defines (Depth pre-pass, Resource path)
- Update dependency libs
- Doxygen integration for documentation
- Logging system
- Debounce spam resize calls
- Separate mesh into mesh-data and mesh-resource. 
- Separate texture into texture-data and texture-resource. 
- Clean up light emitter, pack shadow buffer inside, move shader binding code into light

OPTIMIZATION
- Frustum culling
- Uniform buffer
- SIMD math

RESOURCES
- Textures	-> .PBT
- Mesh		-> .PBM
- Shader	-> .JSON
- Scene 	-> .JSON
- Material 	-> .JSON

BUGS
- Eye-adaptation freaking out with high frame rate
- Fix FXAA
- CubeMap memory leak
- Cubemap does not generate a serialized texture
