RENDERING
- Instanced rendering
- Deferred decals
- Switch to GTAO
- TAA
- Draw handles
- GBuffer packing
- Dynamic Shadow bounding update
- Anisotropic filtering

GENERAL
- Resource manager
	- Protected constructors for managed resources
	- Load next before unload to pass already loaded resources
- Recursive light map generation with light conservation
- Precompile shader
- GL-State system: define all needed properties before draw call. System compares 
	what state is to what it should be and only changes properties that are needed.
- License - MIT?
- Wrap everything in PhotonBox name space
- Abstraction layer over OpenGL
- Precompiled headers
- Switch to dll
- User Premake or CMake
- Decouple asset conversion into its own Project (AssetCompiler)
- Create Shader as JSON resource -> Eliminate Shader classes
- (Move Scene classes to JSON resources)
- General configuration for static defines (Depth pre-pass, Resource path)
- Update dependency libs
- Doxygen integration for documentation
- Logging system

OPTIMIZATION
- Zlib binary file compression
- Switch image format to compressed dds
- Frustum culling
- Uniform buffer
- Run Filewatcher parallel in an interval
- SIMD math
- Multithreaded resource loading

RESOURCES
- Textures	-> .PBT
- Mesh		-> .PBM
- Shader	-> .JSON
- Scene 	-> .JSON
- Material 	-> .JSON

BUGS
- Eye-adaptation freaking out with high frame rate
- SSReflection overflowing colors when too bright
- Fix FXAA
