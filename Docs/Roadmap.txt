RENDERING
- Deferred decals
- Switch to GTAO
- GBuffer packing
- Anisotropic filtering

GENERAL
- Recursive light map generation with light conservation
- Precompile shader
- GL-State system: define all needed properties before draw call. System compares 
	what state is to what it should be and only changes properties that are needed.
- Wrap everything in PhotonBox name space
- Precompiled headers
- Switch to dll
- Decouple asset conversion into its own Project (AssetCompiler)
- (Move Scene classes to JSON resources)
- General configuration for static defines (Depth pre-pass, Resource path)
- Update dependency libs
- Doxygen integration for documentation
- Debounce spam resize calls 
- Clean up light emitter, pack shadow buffer inside, move shader binding code into light
- Add Post processor component so the post processing is bound to a camera
- Make include guards more unique

OPTIMIZATION
- Uniform buffer

BUGS
- Eye-adaptation freaking out with high frame rate
- Fix FXAA
- CubeMap memory leak
- Cubemap does not generate a serialized texture
